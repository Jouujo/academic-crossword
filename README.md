# Academic Mini Crossword

An internal web application built to help **tutors** create and share **5x5 academic crosswords** with their students.  
The project streamlines tutor prep, reinforces subject-specific terminology, and gamifies review sessions ‚Äî improving both **efficiency for tutors** and **engagement for students**.

## Problem & Impact
Tutors often need quick, engaging activities to reinforce key concepts. Preparing these activities manually is time-consuming and inconsistent across sessions.

**With Academic Mini Crossword:**
- Tutors can generate a subject-specific puzzle in under **2 minutes**.  
- Puzzles are **stored, tagged, and reusable**, reducing redundant prep work.  
- Students engage with academic material through an **interactive, gamified experience**.  
- The tool is scalable: future tutors can build on a growing library of puzzles.  

This reduces prep time, **standardizes materials**, and ensures students are practicing terminology in a fun and memorable way.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- Built with **React + Next.js** for modular, server-rendered components.  
- **Dynamic grid generator** automatically converts tutor inputs (clues/answers) into a playable crossword layout.  
- **TailwindCSS** used for consistent, accessible styling (color-blind safe palettes, responsive grid).  

### Backend & Database
- **Firebase Firestore** stores puzzle metadata (clues, answers, subject tags).  
- **Firebase Security Rules** restrict writes to authorized tutors and limit deletions to admins.  
- **Access Control** implemented via an **access code system** (currently `TC2025`) to prevent unauthorized puzzle creation.  

### Hosting & Deployment
- Deployed on **Vercel** with CI/CD from GitHub.  
- Automatic redeployment on commits ‚Üí ensures tutors always see the latest stable version.  

### Utilities
- **NanoID** used to generate unique puzzle IDs for reliable puzzle lookup and sharing.
